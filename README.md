# slock - a fork of the suckless screenlocker for the _extremely_ paranoid

This is my personal fork of slock. It is the only screenlocker secure enough
for me to use.

## Changes from the original Slock

- Custom Password: You can provide a custom password so you don't have to enter
  your user password on the X server. Simply create a ~/.slock_passwd file with
  your separate password in it.

- GRSecurity BadUSB Prevention: If you have GRSecurity patched onto and enabled
  in your kernel, when slock is started, all new USB devices will be disabled.
  This requires that the kernel.grsecurity.grsec_lock sysctl option be set to 0,
  which is a security risk to an attacker with local access. If you enable
  STRICT\_USBOFF when slock comes on, kernel.grsecurity.grsec_lock will be set
  to 1 and new USB devices will denied until you reboot.

  You will need to have this line in your /etc/sysctl.d/grsec.conf

        kernel.grsecurity.grsec_lock = 0

  and it also requires the same permissions as Automatic Shutdown in
  /etc/sudoers.

- Alarms: A siren will play if a user enters an incorrect password. It must
  reside in ~/slock.

- Automatic Shutdown: Your machine will immediately shutdown if:

  1. The wrong password is entered more than 5 times.

  2. ALT/CTRL/F1-F13 is pressed to switch VTs or to try to kill the X server.
     Also, if ALT+SYSRQ is attempted to be used.

  - Automatic shutdown requires a sudoers option to be set in /etc/sudoers:

    - systemd: `[username] [hostname] =NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl poweroff`
    - sysvinit: `[username] [hostname] =NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/shutdown -h now`

    You must change [username] and [hostname] to your username and the hostname
    of the machine.

    NOTE: It is wise to combine this feature with a bios password as well as an
    encrypted home+swap partition. Once your machine is powered off. Your data
    is no longer accessible in any manner.

- Webcam Support: Webcam support has been disabled. You should tape over your
  webcam. Or just disconnect it. In lieu of this, some identification and
  geolocation tools will be configurable at compile time.

- Twilio Support: Twilio is disabled in this version of the app while it is
  replaced with a distributed option, probably based on email or ratox. Since
  most phone services provide e-mail to SMS gateways this is an option that
  provides greater liberty.

  For now, the Twilio code has been left in, the legacy readme section is below.

        You will receive an SMS to your phone when someone inputs a
        wrong password or pressed ALT/CTRL/F1-13/SYSRQ. See twilio_example.h to create a
        twilio.h file. You will need a twilio account to set this up.

        These SMS's can optionally be MMS's containing a webcam shot of whoever is
        potentially tampering with your machine.

- Disabling alt+sysrq and ctrl+alt+backspace before shutting down: This
  prevents an attacker from killing the screenlock quickly before the shutdown.

  - This requires a sudoers option to be set in /etc/sudoers:

    - `[username] [hostname] =NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq`

    You must change [username] and [hostname] to your username and the hostname
    of the machine.

- Transparent Lock Screen

  - The lock screen is now an ARGB window. The screen will dim on lock (or turn
    black with no compositor).

## Requirements

In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.

- Potential runtime deps: sudo, ffmpeg, setxkbmap, curl, aplay
- Other potential requirements: a twilio account, an imgur account

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

``` bash
$ make clean install
```

## Running slock

Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
